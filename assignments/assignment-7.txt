create a Java application to find out every word in a string and its occurrences and display the word and its occurrences in sorted manner (sorted alphabetically by the words)

Java is a programming language, I use Java for coding in any application.
I went to cafe coffe day to have a cup of coffe.

a:1
any:1
application:1
coding:1
for:1
...
Java:2

main(){
	//ask user enter a sentence
	//call getWordsAndCount and pass the sentence
	//get the return collection
	//print the way iot expected
}

static RT getWordsAndCount(String sentence){
	//code
	//return collection of wrords and count for each
}
