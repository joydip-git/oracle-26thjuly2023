CSS: Cascading Style Sheet

	css-property-name:property-value
	width:50px
	background-color:"black";
	margin-left:10px;
	padding:2px;

1. in-line style
	- using style attribute of the element provide the styles

2. out-line style
	- using style tag in the same HTML file
		- mention the element name(s) and then create the style [element selector]
		- mention the id (s) of the element name(s) and then create the style [id selector]
		- do not mention either the name(s) of element(s) or id(s) of element(s). rather create a "class" and then create the styles. apply the style later on the element(s) using class attribute [class selector]

	(extrnal CSS)
	- by creating a separate CSS file and then linking the CSS file with the HTML file
		- mention the element name(s) and then create the style [element selector]
		- mention the id (s) of the element name(s) and then create the style [id selector]
		- do not mention either the name(s) of element(s) or id(s) of element(s). rather create a "class" and then create the styles. apply the style later on the element(s) using class attribute [class selector]

state of the element:
	not yet visited
	hovering over the link
